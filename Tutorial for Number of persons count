The program for the number of faces that is number of persons are available on the screen can be done with the code.

So the Requirements are 
        1.Haarcascade file such that ProfileFace .xml file so u can just download from the github.
        2.The pretrained model named 'cnncat2.h5' this model must be loaded to improve the accuracy.
        3.To load that model we must have KERAS to be installed.Such that the model can be easily be loaded.
        
Now We can Run this by giving the image as input or we can  just do it by live webcam.
Finally,The Total number of FACES are printted ont the screen.
That's the final result.
Thank You.
